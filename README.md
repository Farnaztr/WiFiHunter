-  Supports WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3 detection
-  100% native Windows support (no admin rights needed in most cases)

## How It Works

WiFiHunter uses the native Windows `netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid` command to collect Wi-Fi network data.

```bash
SSID: MyNetwork, Signal: 87%, Encryption: WPA2-Personal
